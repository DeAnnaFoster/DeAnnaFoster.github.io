                            Saved approximately 4 hours per day/person by developing an application that parsed internal webpages then filtered and displayed
                            results and highlighted failures for further triaging. This replaced the use of 6 web browser
                            windows, approximately 90+ tabs and having to constantly review each page for test failures.

                            truncated list of sites/vendors utilized thereby preventing use of those resources. Investigated
                            and developed solution to correct the problem while maintaining data and providing for future

                            Improved the operation of a script that took approximately 4 hours every morning to run. After rewriting the loop that performed
                            the final operation the script ran substantially faster. So much so that I was told it was broken!
                            The script now completes in approximately 5 minutes.
